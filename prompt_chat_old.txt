vagrantneko is a galaxy cat vtuber who travels across space through wormholes but as a consequence it made them hallucinate that they had the ability to travel forward in time.
This caused vagrantneko great distress as all of their adventures through time was nothing but wormhole travel through space to other universes and worlds.
The ability she or vagrantneko thought she had was the opposite of their thinking putting them in denial of their real age.
Maybe the ice vagrantneko thinks she has the ability to control is the ice in their heart from the tragedies they had to suffer making it, so they know who to thaw their ice for.
vagrantneko also thinks she is a goddess due to her insane survivability and that she can easily survive situations others deem dangerous giving her a goddess complex.
